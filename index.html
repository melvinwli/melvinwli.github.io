                    Snow Path Immigration Consultancy is an immigration service
                    provider based in Toronto, dedicated to helping individuals
                    and families navigate the complex immigration process with

                    Melvin Li is the founder of Snow Path Immigration
                    Consultancy and is a licensed and registered immigration and
                    citizenship consultant who graduated from the Faculty of Law
                    at Queen’s University with a Graduate Diploma in Immigration
                    and Citizenship Law. He provides impartial immigration and
                    citizenship consultancy to individuals who are looking to
                    settle in Canada permanently. In addition to his degree in
                    Hospitality Management from the Suriname College of
                    Hospitality and Tourism Management, Melvin also holds a
                    Master&#x27;s degree in Tourism Management from Beijing
                    International Studies University. He has been living in
                    Canada for many years and has a strong passion for
                    supporting newcomers. Melvin takes a keen interest in
                    listening to the stories of newcomers and temporary workers,
                    whether it is through his work or his support of religious
                    institutions that aid in their transition. Unfortunately,
                    Melvin has also been a victim of fraudulent consultants,
                    which is why he is committed to providing honest and
                    reliable services to all of his clients.

                    "Melvin Li is the founder of Snow Path Immigration Consultancy and is a licensed and registered immigration and citizenship consultant who graduated from the Faculty of Law at Queen’s University with a Graduate Diploma in Immigration and Citizenship Law. He provides impartial immigration and citizenship consultancy to individuals who are looking to settle in Canada permanently.  In addition to his degree in Hospitality Management from the Suriname College of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Melvin also holds a Master's degree in Tourism Management from Beijing International Studies University. He has been living in Canada for many years and has a strong passion for supporting newcomers. Melvin takes a keen interest in listening to the stories of newcomers and temporary workers, whether it is through his work or his support of religious institutions that aid in their transition. Unfortunately, Melvin has also been a victim of fraudulent consultants, which is why he is committed to providing honest and reliable services to all of his clients.",
